## ðŸ§  AI Workflow Rules

1. **Think before coding** â€“ Understand the problem deeply.
2. **Read before acting** â€“ Explore the codebase and locate relevant files.
3. **Plan everything** â€“ Document a step-by-step plan in `project_report.md`, including:

   * âœ… Clear TODOs
   * ðŸ”¹ Small, simple tasks only
4. **Wait for approval** â€“ **Do not code** until I approve the plan.
5. **One step at a time** â€“ Tackle tasks incrementally and commit separately.
6. **Keep it minimal** â€“ Avoid overengineering. Every change must be:

   * Small
   * Isolated
   * Understandable
7. **Explain changes** â€“ Write a clear, high-level explanation after every task.
8. **Write a final review** â€“ After all tasks, update `project_report.md` with:

   * Reason for changes
   * Any notes or remaining tasks
