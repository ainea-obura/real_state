- the tenant can register his accounts, look the profile in the tenant frontend features/clients/tabs/tenantAccounts.tsx, that way is what i want, but this is mobile, design can be different, but the flow should be the same.

- tenant can update his information, look at the profile of the tenant in the frontend, and understand how the app should work. what he can update is first_name, last_name, email, phone (with country code selection as we did in the frontend), and gender.

- user can change his password, look how we did in features/settings/tabs/change-password.tsx, and understand how the app should work.

- user can see his properties that is he is leaves in, look at the profile of the tenant in the frontend, and understand how the app should work.

- last is the list of all of his invoices, making payments, and see the status of the invoices. plus the list of all of his payments, and see the status of the payments.
